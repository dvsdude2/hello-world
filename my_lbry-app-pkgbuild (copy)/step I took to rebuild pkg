#LBRY PKGBUILD (MY FIRST)
-----------------------------------------

###these are the step I took to rebuild unmaintained package



clone repo from git hub or find deb file
use debtap app to make pkgbuild file
used old pkgbuild file to fix the new one
change -dependants to:

depends=('libnotify' 'libappindicator-gtk2' 'libxtst' 'nss' 'libsecret')

and the bttm 6 lines to:

package() {
    install -dm 755 "$pkgdir/usr/bin/"
    tar -xf "$srcdir/data.tar.xz" -C "$pkgdir"
    ln -s "/opt/LBRY/lbry" "$pkgdir/usr/bin/lbry"
    ln -s "/opt/LBRY/resources/static/daemon/lbrynet" "$pkgdir/usr/bin/"
}
